Future goals:
1.Develop a zero-shot object detection model from scratch (because it's an exciting challenge).
2.Implement the model to process and analyze real-time video feeds.
3.Explore time-series datasets and gain insights from Kaggle, with a potential extension towards building a traffic prediction dataset.
